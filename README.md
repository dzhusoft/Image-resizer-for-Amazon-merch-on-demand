# Image-resizer-for-Amazon-merch-on-demand
## Description
This is a tool which enables the users to resize the images that are created for the Amazon merch on demand to different sizes, this will look for the main content of the picture and fit it inside other sizes without changing the ratio.

## How to get this tool
In order to use this tool, you need to buy it from the developer for "100 Euros" through PayPal at the link: [https://paypal.me/abdoudzhu]
Also you need to send a signed declaration as PNG or PDF that you paid the amount to use the software to [dzhusoft@gmail.com].
The declaration is attached with the repository and you should include your full name and the transaction ID.

Those who are working in such a job are making good money, so, 100 Euros is not that big amount I guess.

## First use
You need to download the application, run it, it will show a generated code (see the following picture), send it together with the declaration to [dzhusoft@gmail.com] and I will send you back the other 3 codes for the authentication, this will register your copy and you don't have to do this process again only if you change your computer.
Changing the computer or the user means that you need to buy it again.

## How to use
This tool enables you to safely convert your images to different sizes that are used in the Amazon Merch On Demand (see the following pictures).

It will automatically look for the "main content*" of the picture inside the main image (4500px*5400px) then it will fit it inside all the other available size at the Amazon Merch on Demand which are:
4500px * 4050px,
485px * 485px,
1800px * 3200px,
2925px * 2925px.
However, You can Add a new size at any time you want. The values of the new Width and Height needs to be between 100px and 12000px.

You have to provide a valid picture at the main size (4500px*5400px), wait some seconds until it check if this is a valid picture, then press the button "Resize" and wait until the end of resizing.

*The main content is every pixel which does not have a full transparency value (Alpha value of 255 from the RGBA image).
